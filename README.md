aroma_w
--------------
This is my second python project at work. You can watch it live by clicking on the link https://aroma-sister-test.herokuapp.com/ 

Development setup
---------------
In a Python 3.8.8 virtual environment:

    $ cd requirements
    $ pip install -r development.txt
    $ cd ..
    $ python manage.py migrate

Now you can start the development server:

    $ python manage.py runserver
